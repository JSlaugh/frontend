                There are two main parts to the BYU Egypt Excavation Project.
                The part with which this database is concerned is the Fag
                el-Gamous cemetery. This cemetery was in use during the
                Graeco-Roman era of Egyptian history. In the early 1900â€™s some
                Mummy Portraits were found there by Bernard Grenfell and Arthur
                Hunt. The cemetery is very large and densely populated with
                burials. Some lie in the mudstone escarpments, where tombs were
                carved into the rocks. These are typically somewhat wealthier
                burials, including a golden masked mummy who was the daughter of
                a priest in the Ptolemaic period. Most of the burials lie loose
                in the sand. These burials range from being fully skeletonized
                to being extremely well preserved. They range from just after
                300 BC to about 500 AD. During that time period nearly all of
                the inhabitants of the Fayoum converted to Christianity. There
                is some evidence for this in the burials. We are doing vigorous
                research attempting to determine if there are more detectable
                archaeological markers pointing to Christian burial practices.

                This large cemetery population allows for significant
                statistical studies of burial practices. It has afforded a
                marvelous opportunity for demographic studies. Our textile
                analyses are providing significant new insights into changing
                burial patterns and the multiple and varied uses to which
                textiles were put. Because all of our textiles derive from a
                known setting, some of our most important work involves
                identifying and describing original in situ contexts that can be
                generalized to the many museum collections of uncertain
                provenance. We have also been able to study weaving practices,
                the use of tunics in various time periods, the use of sprang
                hairnets in various time periods, and a number of other textile
                studies. Analysis of amulets, figurines, pottery, jewelry, and
                other burial goods has also been possible. The site is among the
                most promising for telling us statistically significant
                information about burial practices in Graeco-Roman Egypt for the
                common person.

                The other part of the excavation is of the Seila Pyramid. Our
                discovery of a stela with two of the names of Snefru, first king
                of the Fourth Dynasty, revealed who had built the pyramid. It
                lies 10 km due west of the Meidum Pyramid, and in terms of its
                elevation and the ratio of its construction, there are some
                clear links between the two pyramids. The Seila Pyramid has
                evidence for ritual activity on both the north and the eastern
                sides. It has a causeway on the eastern side, but no valley
                temple. It represents an important witness of Snefruâ€™s
                innovations in regard to pyramid complexes, and play an
                important role in the development of pyramids. Besides the
                stelae, other important artifacts include an altar, the remains
                of a small statue, a foundation deposit jar, a model oar, and
                the remains of several limestone tables or altars.

                Our most recent publications may best highlight some of the
                research that is possible from the longstanding excavations
                performed by Brigham Young University (BYU). The fist book
                listed includes chapters on the geography and history of the
                region, history of the BYU Excavations, the ritual ramifications
                of the excavation of the Seila Pyramid, a report on ritual
                objects on the northern side of the Seila Pyramid, an analysis
                of common burial practices at the cemetery, a ground-breaking
                report on which mummy portraits came from Fag el-Gamous, an
                analysis of the kinds of weaves used in burial clothing, an
                analysis of the use of jewelry in burials, an analysis of the
                kinds of dyes used to obtain purple clothing in the burials, a
                paleopathological study of some of the crania found among the
                burials, an analysis of pottery with a specific kind of hole, a
                report on the kinds of grain found with burials, a translation
                of papyrus found in the cemetery, and a report of a survey done
                of the nearby town of Philadelphia.
